# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 1st, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first two modules on freecodecamp, which focused on HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts:** I knew some of this already, so I was able to complete things fairly quickly.

### Day 2: March 2nd, 2022
**Today's Progress**: Completed the Applied Visual Design module on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: Although I can complete tasks, I don't think I fully understand what everything means. Without prompting, I'd be lost. Maybe I should start taking notes...
